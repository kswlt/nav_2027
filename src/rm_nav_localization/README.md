# rm_nav_localization

LIO adapter, chassis resolver, state estimation and relocalization.

This package is part of the RM Nav V2 staged implementation.

The first implemented component is `ChassisResolver`. It applies the PDF-defined relation:

```text
world_T_chassis = world_T_lidar * inverse(chassis_T_lidar(t))
```

It does not filter, publish TF, or invent timestamps. Those responsibilities stay with the Sensor Hub, `robot_localization`, and the TF authority layer.

`CandidateRegionGenerator` limits global recovery search to `max_speed * lost_time + safety_margin`, clipped to official field bounds. KISS and GICP adapters consume this region but do not own its policy.
